# Unit_Converter_in_Kotlin
Unit converter - conversion among different lengths, temperature and weights measures as appropriate
About
When you travel, everything changes: people, languages, time zones, and even units. It may be difficult to read the temperature in Fahrenheit when you’ve always used Celsius, or to measure yourself in kilos if you’ve only used pounds. It’s no easy matter, though a nice unit converter could certainly help! In this project, you will write a converter that handles distance, weight, and temperature units – all the traveller’s essentials.
Skills focus areas
The basics of coding in Kotlin: loops, conditions, and data input and output.
